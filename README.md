# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
Applying Logistic Regression and making it from scratch without using Sklearn

    Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, independent variables.

Using the US Adult Census data

    Kaggle link https://www.kaggle.com/johnolafenwa/us-census-data

If you're directly downloading the dataset from above link than you have to add column names to it or you can use my uploaded dataset, i have already added column names to it.

Also Uploading Dataset

    adult-training.csv
    adult-testing.csv
          
Making Logistic regression from scratch without use of sklearn

    defining funtions:

    Hypothesis using Sigmoid function
    Calculating Loss function
    Fit
    Predict

    After this we can use Logistic Regression as we were using in Sklearn lib

    1. fitting values in model
    2. predicting the values
    3. Final Accuracy

I am getting 77 % by setting iteration = 1000 and setting learning rate 0.01.

If you want to improve accuracy change the iteration to 10,000 or to 1,00,000.
